It looks right because Neural network models are good at classifying when we have a labeled dataset like iris and SVM is good for finding an optimal boundary between outputs.  While K-NN is sensitive to noisy data and outliears and so does logistic regression. Hence we might need to modify the data before traning in order to get accurate traning results for K-NN and Logistic regression.   "
